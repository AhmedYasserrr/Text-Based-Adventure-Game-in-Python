# Text-Based-Adventure-Game-in-Python
This is a written adventure game that includes two characters of different genders to play with. Every character has different health and power features. 

After choosing the character, the game will start, and you have to make certain decisions to attack different types of monsters, specifically four types (dwarfs, snakes, giants, and the great mother). Everything will be more clear once you try to play. Just run the Python code and the game will guide you.
Wishing you the best of luck in your game tonight. Always remember that playing with honesty is the most important thing.
Good luck!!
